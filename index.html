        <h2>About Jase Grable</h2>
        <img src="img/Hogwarts.jpg">
        <p>My previous experience is in the banking and investments industry. I started as a part time teller for Umpqua
            bank and most recently worked for M Financial in Portland, OR as a comission specialist. Please see below
            for my
            resume.</p>
        <p>I decided to take a class on programming to expand my skillset. I have always been interested in computers
            and
            wanted to take away some of the mysticism of coding.</p>

        <h3>Hobbies & Interests</h3>
        <p>Due to the amazing nature of ADHD, I have many interests and hobbies. I have <strong>4 cats</strong> with my
            wife
            who we spoil
            unashamedly. We spend a lot of our days reading and hanging out on the deck in our first house we bought
            recently.</p>
        <p>Some other interests of mine include the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>anime</li>
            <li>video games</li>
            <li>hip hop music</li>
            <li>I absolutely <em>LOVE</em> to read</li>
