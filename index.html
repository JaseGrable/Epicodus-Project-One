    <h2>About Jase Grable</h2>
    <p>My previous experience is in the banking and investments industry. I started as a part time teller for Umpqua
        bank and most recently worked for M Financial in Portland, OR as a comission specialist. Please see below for my
        resume.</p>
    <p>I decided to take a class on programming to expand my skillset. I have always been interested in computers and
        wanted to take away some of the mysticism of coding.</p>
    <h3>Experience</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Umpqua Bank 2012-2014</li>
        <li>Fisher Investments 2014-2018</li>
        <li>Contract Positions at various companies 2019-2022</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Hobbies & Interests</h3>
    <p>Due to the amazing nature of ADHD, I have many interests and hobbies. I have <strong>4 cats</strong> with my wife
        who we spoil
        unashamedly. We spend a lot of our days reading and hanging out on the deck in our first house we bought
        recently.</p>
    <p>Some other interests of mine include the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>anime</li>
        <li>video games</li>
        <li>hip hop music</li>
        <li>I absolutely <em>LOVE</em> to read</li>
    </ul>
